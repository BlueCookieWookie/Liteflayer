Liteflayer is an **efficient** brainwallet cracker tailored for Litecoin. It leverages the power of Python, while maintaining performance on par with native C applications like Brainflayer. It is based on the concept of Brainflayer but with a wordlist generator built right in to it that allows you to easily streamline huge wordlists without having to give up the disk space to put it in a file.

> **Make sure to put the Litecoin addresses you want to check against in a file named 'addresses.txt'**
> **If you modify your addresses.txt list, delete the 'addresses.bloom' file before running or else it won't include new changes**

- **High-Speed Key Derivation:** With the _bit_ library, Liteflayer swiftly derives public keys and addresses from private keys.
- **Rapid Membership Checks:** The use of _pybloomfiltermmap3_ ensures that address checks against large datasets are lightning-fast, optimizing the cracking process.
- **Multiprocessing Support:** Liteflayer distributes tasks across all available CPU cores, further bolstering the cracking speed.
- **Customizable Wordlist Generation:** Users can customize wordlist generation parameters, allowing for targeted brute-force attacks.
