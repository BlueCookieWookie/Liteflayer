# _Liteflayer_
is an extremely **optimized** brainwallet cracker tailored for Litecoin. It leverages the power of Python and is based on the concept of _Brainflayer_ but with an added wordlist generator built right in that allows you to easily streamline huge wordlists to Liteflayer without having to give up the disk space to store the entire list.

> **- Make sure to put the Litecoin addresses that you want to check against inside a file named 'addresses.txt'**
> 
> **- If you modify your addresses.txt list, make sure to delete the 'addresses.bloom' file before running again or else it won't include the new changes**
